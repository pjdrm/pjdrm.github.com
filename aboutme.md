My name is Pedro Mota and I am a Ph.D student in a dual degree program between Carnegie Mellon University and TÃ©cnico Lisboa. My research work is an application of Bayesian models to document topic segmentation.
When I am not busy working towards my degree I split my time between dancing tango and playing guitar.
